## 🚀 Capabilities

- 🎯 **Protocol Fuzzing** (SMBv1, RDP, DNS)
- 💥 **EternalBlue Exploit Chain** for Windows targets
- 🧠 **Shellcode Generator** (x64 polymorphic, encrypted)
- 🧬 **Process Injection** (Direct Syscalls + Hollowing)
- 🛡️ **Shellcode Encryptors** (AES, ChaCha20, XOR fallback)
- 🧪 **Simulated Win32 Heap Manipulation**
- 🔍 **PoC Generator** with crash logging
- ✅ **Self-Test Suite** — verify tool integrity without a target
